# Radians-Degrees

Whilst doing a University degree, I needed to be able to convert Radians to Degrees very frequently.
I decided that to save time I would create this Rad-Deg converter. I'm sure there are many different ways of doing it but this is mine.

This code asks the user for an input in Radians and gives an output in degrees. A simple programme.
